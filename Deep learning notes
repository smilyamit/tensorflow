#1 n-f +1 is a formula to get output of convoluted layer
eg n = no of inputs in pixels in matrix form eg 6X6
   f = no of filters eg 3X3. i.e 6-3 = 4
   
 # types of padding
 1 padding by zero
 2 padding by nearest border value
 ***importance 
 -> It allows us to design deeper networks. Without padding, reduction in volume size would reduce too quickly.
 -> Padding actually improves performance by keeping information at the borders
 -> It's easier to design networks if we preserve the height and width and don't have to worry too much about tensor
    dimensions when going from one layer to another because dimensions will just "work"
