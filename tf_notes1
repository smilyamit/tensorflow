Note: The number of batches is equal to number of iterations for one epoch.
Letâ€™s say we have 2000 training examples (rows)that we are going to use.
batch_size = 500
steps_per_epoch/iteration/no of Batches = 4
1 epoch = 500*4 = 2000

#2
-in ff(feed forward) network we calculate loss function
-in bp(back propagation) network we update the weights based on loss function
