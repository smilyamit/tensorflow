#1
To check the default environment location in mac: /opt/anaconda3/envs/tf. (make sure u r in default position in terminal)

#2 (for OS X or Linux)
Run the following commands to setup your environment:

conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
source activate tensorflow
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

AND
Windows

And installing on Windows. In your console or Anaconda shell,

conda create -n tensorflow python=3.5
activate tensorflow
conda install pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn
pip install tensorflow

#3 tf.constant
All eager `tf.Tensor` values are immutable (in contrast to
`tf.Variable`). There is nothing especially _constant_ about the value
returned from `tf.constant`. This function it is not fundamentally different
from `tf.convert_to_tensor`.


#4
TensorFlow Linear Functions
y = xW + b   # y-output, x- input, W-weights, b-bias

Weights and Bias in TensorFlow
-The goal of training a neural network is to modify weights and biases to best predict the labels. 
In order to use weights and bias, you'll need a Tensor that can be modified. This leaves out tf.placeholder() and
tf.constant(), 
-since those Tensors can't be modified. This is where tf.Variable class comes in.
#5
randn means randomly normally distributed no
randint means randomly uniformly distributed no
